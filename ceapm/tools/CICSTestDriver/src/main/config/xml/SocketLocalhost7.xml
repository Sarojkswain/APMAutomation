	<description>This uses socket to connect with Windows Echo Service on Port 7. This sample program can be tested with windows by installing "Simple TCP/IP Services".  Look up how to install that from the internet.  Once installed the localhost port 7 will echo whatever you send to it back.   So if you open a command prompt and type "telnet localhost 7" it will just echo your keystrokes back at you from that point on.    You can terminate that by closing the command prompt window.

How do you turn on or off the Simple TCP/IP Services (and install them)?
To turn on (enable) simple TCP/IP services, you just need to go into Control Panel, to Programs, then to Turn Windows Features on or off. You do not need to install any applications.
From here, click on the checkbox for the Simple TCP/IP Services

Once the windows echo server is installed then you can installed CICSTestDriver and run the  bat file called SocketLocalhost7.bat to test if things are working.</description>
